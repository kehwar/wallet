# Wallet PWA

A Local-First Progressive Web Application for personal finance management with offline-first architecture and strict double-entry accounting.

## 🚀 Overview

This wallet application implements a comprehensive personal finance system that:
- **Works Offline**: All data stored locally in IndexedDB, fully functional without internet
- **Maintains Accounting Integrity**: Strict double-entry bookkeeping with balanced debits and credits
- **Handles Multiple Currencies**: Triple truth system (Display, Account, Budget) with frozen exchange rates
- **Syncs Optionally**: BYOB (Bring Your Own Backend) - sync to your own Firestore instance when needed
- **Resolves Conflicts Automatically**: Last-Write-Wins (LWW) strategy for seamless multi-device usage

## ✨ Key Features

### Local-First Architecture
- All data stored in browser's IndexedDB for instant access
- Full functionality offline - no internet required for day-to-day use
- Optional synchronization to user's personal Firestore instance

### Double-Entry Accounting
- Every transaction maintains balanced debits and credits
- Preserves the accounting equation: `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`
- Editable entries with direct corrections or reversing entries

### Multi-Currency Support
- **Display Currency**: What you see in the UI (configurable)
- **Account Currency**: Native currency of each account
- **Budget Currency**: Your home currency for budgeting
- Exchange rates frozen at transaction time for historical accuracy

### Offline Sync Strategy
- Last-Write-Wins (LWW) conflict resolution
- Atomic sync for transaction groups (all ledger entries together)
- Uses `_lww_timestamp`, `_device_id`, `_version` for conflict detection

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt 4.3 with PWA support
- **UI Components**: shadcn-vue
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (via Dexie.js)
- **Sync**: Firebase JS SDK (optional, user-configured)
- **Math**: decimal.js (avoids floating point errors)

## 📖 Documentation

- **[GitHub Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md)** - Essential project overview and development guidelines
- **[Database Schema](docs/database-schema.md)** - Complete data models, IndexedDB and Firestore schemas
- **[Implementation Plan](docs/implementation-plan.md)** - Phased development roadmap and technical details

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Local-First**: App must work fully offline with optional sync
2. **Double-Entry**: All transactions balanced, maintaining accounting integrity
3. **Denormalized Ledger**: Self-contained entries for efficient offline queries
4. **UUID-Based**: Conflict-free ID generation for distributed systems
5. **Frozen Exchange Rates**: Historical accuracy without data corruption

## 🔧 Development Status

**Overall Progress: 90% Complete**

**Phase 1 Complete: Core Data Layer** ✅

**Phase 3 Complete: PWA Foundation** ✅  
**Phase 4 Complete: Sync Implementation** ✅  
**Phase 5 Complete: User Interface** ✅  
**Phase 6 Nearly Complete: Testing & Optimization** ✅ (90% complete)

### Quick Stats
- **Code Base**: ~6,000 lines of TypeScript
- **Test Coverage**: 106 unit tests (82% statements, 94% branches) + 47 active E2E tests
- **Build Size**: 403 KB gzipped (1.67 MB uncompressed)
- **Dependencies**: 5 production, 16 dev (zero critical vulnerabilities)
- **Pages**: 6 complete UI pages with full functionality

### Phase 1: Core Data Layer
The core data layer has been implemented with:

- ✅ Bidirectional sync (upload and download)
- ✅ Device tracking with persistent device IDs
- ✅ Sync status UI with real-time indicators
- ✅ Firebase configuration page
- ✅ Firestore security rules documentation

### Phase 5: User Interface
The complete user interface has been delivered with:
- ✅ 6 pages: Home, Accounts, Transactions, Budgets, Reports, Settings
- ✅ Transaction forms (Expense, Income, Transfer modals)
- ✅ Account management with balance display
- ✅ Budget tracking with spending totals
- ✅ Financial reports (Net Worth, Income vs Expenses)
- ✅ Responsive navigation and mobile-first design

### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization
The testing and optimization phase is nearly complete (90% complete):
- ✅ Playwright E2E testing infrastructure
- ✅ 47 active E2E tests across 9 test suites (3 skipped - service worker testing)
- ✅ Automated accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Performance benchmarking tests
- ✅ CI/CD integration for E2E tests
- ✅ Security audit and vulnerability fixes
- ✅ Additional E2E test scenarios (budgets, reports, multi-currency)
- ✅ User documentation (comprehensive user guide)
- ✅ Deployment documentation
- ⏳ Optional performance optimizations (lazy loading, virtual scrolling)
